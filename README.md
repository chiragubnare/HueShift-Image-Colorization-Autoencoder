# grayscale_to_rgb_cnn
This model is based upon Convolutional Neural Network with Transpose convolution autoencoder which converts grayscale(black & white) images to Coloured(RGB) image, trained on csail dataset of mit. Pytorch, matplotlib, skimage, etc libraries of python are used in designing. Google Colab is used for runtime.
